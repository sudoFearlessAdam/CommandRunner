# CommandRunner üñ•Ô∏è
Hi, this is CommandRunner. The project is meant for you so that you can run any windows command using a roblox game!
The project was made on my free time when I was bored so yeah. Anyways i'll tell you how to use this.
# How to use
Step 1: Download python (Preferably version 3.12.8).
Step 2: Download the CommandRunner.zip file from releases.
Step 3: Run the setup.py file then after that script finishes, run the main file, "CommandRunner.py".
Step 4: This will create a new file called "pwd.txt". Open it and type a random password. (DO NOT TYPE/SHARE THIS ANYWHERE ELSE UNLESS ASKED BY THE ROBLOX GAME!)
Step 5: Play the roblox game and enter the IP Address the script shows and the password you set earlier.
Step 6: Now type the command you want to run and then click "Execute Command".
